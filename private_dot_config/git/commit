# docs: user-facing documentation, templates, docstrings, CLI help output
# feat: new feature or extends existing functionality
# fix: resolves bugs or misbehavior
# nit: cosmetic changes (comments, formatting, spelling) with no behavior change
# perf: refactor to improve startup/runtime performance
# refactor: code changes with little user-facing effect
