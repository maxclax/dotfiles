  # 2. Check existing settings: `defaults read com.apple.finder`
  # 3. Use `defaults domains` to see available domains
  # 4. Invalid domains/keys will build but silently fail to apply
  # 5. Some settings require logout/restart to take effect
  # 6. Case sensitivity matters for both domains and keys
